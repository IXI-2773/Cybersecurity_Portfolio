# Network Traffic Analysis & Threat Hunting

**Reproducible synthetic PCAP exercise · 18 focused tests**

A standard-library Python script generates a classic Ethernet/IPv4 PCAP containing **20 fabricated packets**. A bounded offline analyzer decodes DNS/HTTP observations and produces two **triage candidates**, not confirmed malicious behavior.

| Rule | Fabricated result |
| --- | --- |
| DNS NXDOMAIN cluster | Four matching NXDOMAIN replies in 36 seconds |
| HTTP POST review | POST to `collector.invalid/upload` |
| Benign comparisons | Normal DNS reply and HTTP GET |

These are offline **illustrations**, not Wireshark screenshots. The [source-linked analyst report](03-network-pcap/CASE_REPORT.md) identifies packet frames **1–20**, exact trigger times, controls and a proportionate synthetic-only disposition. Manual Wireshark inspection has not been performed.
