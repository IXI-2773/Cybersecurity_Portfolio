# Celestial Resonance — Reproducible Engineering

**Don Lopez · Private engineering project · Public-safe summary**

Celestial Resonance (CR) is a research and experimentation platform. The central engineering question is how to make experimental claims reviewable: which inputs were used, what they were compared against, what evidence exists, and whether the result can be repeated.

## Transferable engineering practices

- **Reproducibility:** retain experiment context, comparison baselines and artifacts.
- **Quality gates:** use focused tests, regression checks and scoped code review rather than assuming a green test run establishes correctness in every case.
- **Evidence records:** distinguish observed output, inference and unresolved uncertainty.
- **Execution controls:** keep research recommendations separate from authorization to modify systems or perform consequential actions.

## A public example of the principle

In the independent authentication lab, the original Splunk time-window logic
returned three of five expected findings. The revised inclusive 600-second
boundary returned all five on the same 64-event scenario matrix. Preserving the
input events, expected findings, original query, revised query, and observed
result made the change inspectable.

This is an example of the traceability that informs my CR engineering approach,
not a CR runtime result or a claim that CR produced the security findings.

## Cybersecurity relevance

A security detection or automated remediation recommendation should also preserve source integrity, reviewable rationale, explicit limits and authorization boundaries. The engineering principles above inform the independent [synthetic security labs](CASE_STUDIES.md) without presenting CR as a deployed security product.

## Scope and proof

This is a high-level overview of **private engineering work**, not a public source release, independent security audit, production deployment, or claim of predictive accuracy. No internal source, repository URL, credentials or sensitive operational details appear here.
