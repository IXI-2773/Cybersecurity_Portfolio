# Splunk Investigation & Evidence Correlation

Inspect an authentication result in Splunk, then follow a separate host-and-packet investigation.

Splunk · Python · Evidence correlation · 2026

**Published Splunk evidence:** five expected findings on 64 synthetic authentication events. Multi-source AD correlation is separately demonstrated in Python.

## The investigation problem

An authentication alert answers only part of an incident question. Understanding what happened requires connecting the account activity to relevant endpoint and network observations, while keeping the sequence and source of each event clear.

## Two inspectable investigation paths

**Splunk authentication:** the [source events](01-authentication-detection/validation_events.csv), [corrected SPL](01-authentication-detection/SPLUNK_MATRIX_BOUNDARY_RETEST.spl) and [saved native panel](../assets/evidence/splunk-native-dashboard-results.png) preserve the original three-of-five discrepancy and corrected five-of-five expected result. Indexed ingestion, scheduled alert firing and independent search-job exports remain open.

**Recorded AD evidence:** a separate Python analysis links OTRF authentication, Sysmon, Kerberos and packet records with same-host process GUIDs, logon sessions and bounded network context. It preserves the 39.812-second difference between a DC execution and its collection. This does not establish that the AD sources were ingested or correlated in Splunk.

## The investigation structure

**Identity context**
Review the account, source address, failure/success sequence and relevant authentication time range.

**Endpoint context**
Look for related execution on the affected system and distinguish suspicious commands from expected administration.

**Network context**
Correlate relevant destinations and connection timing without treating every unusual request as malicious.

**Case timeline**
Keep each event attached to its source, explain gaps and end with a reasoned disposition.

## A decision, not just a dashboard

The report should explain whether the reviewed evidence supports escalation, further collection or a benign explanation. A populated dashboard alone cannot make that decision; an analyst needs to explain the relationships and remaining uncertainty.

## Public work available now

Follow the source events, corrected query and observed panel in the authentication case. The AD analyst report provides the separately executed host/packet correlation, exact references and competing explanations. The analyst workflow shows how I structure validation and handoff.

## Earlier multi-source résumé lab

My résumé describes Splunk dashboards, alert triage and correlation across three or more log sources. Its original source inventory, field mappings, dashboard/query exports and source-linked timeline are not published here. The public authentication panel and separate AD Python analysis do not independently verify that broader Splunk lab.

## Scope and evidence

Splunk results use a synthetic authentication fixture; the separate AD analysis uses OTRF recorded emulation. Neither is a production incident. The AD SPL/Sigma candidates, indexed Splunk ingestion and scheduled alert firing remain unverified.
