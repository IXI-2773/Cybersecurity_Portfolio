# SOC Triage Assistant

Working Python 3.11+ command-line tool for local CSV/JSON security exports.
Standard library only; run from a clone of this repository. No home PC, Splunk,
network, endpoint agent, third-party package or live account access is required.
The process-pattern checks reuse `../02-windows-process-triage/process_triage.py`.

## Run

From the repository root, choose a **new** output directory:

```sh
python projects/10-soc-triage/triage.py projects/10-soc-triage/fixtures/authentication.csv projects/10-soc-triage/fixtures/processes.json --output-dir /tmp/soc-triage-case
```

On Windows, replace `/tmp/soc-triage-case` with a new local directory such as
`soc-triage-case`. Open `report.html` in a browser and inspect `case.json` for the
machine-readable record. Existing output is never overwritten.

Exit **0** means complete processing under the declared schema; **2** means
partial processing with rejected rows preserved; **1** means fatal format/I/O
failure. A complete parse is not a security verdict. The public demo deliberately
returns **2**, because malformed rows must not disappear or look like clean data.

## Supported export contract

CSV requires unique headers; JSON requires an array of objects without duplicate
keys or non-finite numbers. Inputs are bounded to eight files, 5 MiB/file and 5,000
rows/file. This is a bounded utility, not an EVTX parser or universal vendor adapter.

| Field | Accepted names | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Timestamp | `timestamp`, `time`, `TimeCreated` | ISO 8601 with explicit timezone; normalized to UTC |
| User | `username`, `user`, `User` | Required; case preserved; no domain alias inference |
| Host | `host`, `computer`, `Computer` | Required; trimmed and lowercased |
| Event type | `event_type`, `action` | `login_failure`, `login_success`, `process_start`; `event_id=4688` can identify a process event |
| Source IP | `source_ip`, `src_ip`, `IpAddress` | Required for authentication; validated IP; mapped IPv4 normalized |
| Stable event ID | `event_uid`, `record_uid` | Optional; must be stable and unique within a host across supplied exports |
| Process fields | `image`, `command_line` | Required for process records; parent image and positive process ID optional |

Conflicting aliases reject the row. A conflicting host/event UID quarantines all
rows carrying that key. Matching normalized records with the same key coalesce
and keep every source reference. Rows without an event UID remain distinct;
lookalike rows alone do not prove duplicate events. A CSV with extra values is
retained as named fields plus an `extra_values` list, and quarantined.

References such as `S01:R000006` identify input file 1, data record 6. For CSV these
are records after the header, not physical line numbers (quoted multiline fields
can span lines). JSON uses one-based array positions. Input file hashes cover
exact bytes; parsed-record hashes cover the preserved canonical JSON structure.
The output also binds the executed triage and reused process source with hashes.
Reports include original parsed log content; review them before sharing.

## Review checks and limits

- Five or more earlier authentication failures within inclusive 600 seconds,
  followed by success for the same user, host and source IP. Every success resets
  the history. Failures tied with a success timestamp are excluded because their
  ordering is unknown. This is deliberately stricter than the older user/IP lab.
- Reused PowerShell encoded-command and certutil URL-cache/force patterns. The
  tool neither decodes/runs commands nor fetches URLs. Benign use can match.
- No automated severity assignment, compromise verdict, endpoint collection,
  notification, containment or remediation. Rejected rows limit completeness.

## Executed walkthrough and reproduction

The committed fixtures are synthetic and include harmless placeholder commands,
reserved documentation IPs and `example.invalid`. They are not incident telemetry.
The CLI itself was executed against these inputs; report data is not hand-authored.

| Input rows | Accepted events | Duplicate rows | Rejected rows | Review candidates |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 20 | 13 | 1 | 6 | 3 |

The candidates are one authentication sequence, one encoded PowerShell command
and one certutil command. The controls include a below-threshold login sequence,
a diagnostic PowerShell command and a certutil hash check. Six quarantined rows
cover missing timezone, invalid IP, missing command, missing host and two
conflicting copies of one event UID.

1. Open [the actual report](artifacts/report.html) and inspect its PARTIAL status.
2. Follow a candidate's source references to the preserved records.
3. Compare the six rejected records and the duplicate to accepted timeline events.
4. Reproduce the run and verify its exact retained outputs:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s projects/10-soc-triage -p 'test_*.py' -v
python projects/10-soc-triage/run_demo.py --check
```

[Recorded JSON](artifacts/case.json) · [CLI stdout](artifacts/execution.txt)

`run_demo.py` executes the real CLI in a temporary directory, requires its partial
exit status, checks independently declared counts/rule IDs/source references,
then compares JSON, HTML and stdout bytes. Omit `--check` to refresh those retained
artifacts after intentional source/input changes. No speed or production efficacy
claim is made. No private log upload or live SIEM workflow is performed.
